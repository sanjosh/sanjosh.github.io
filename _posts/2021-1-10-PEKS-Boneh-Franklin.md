title: Public key encryption with keyword search
---

This is an attempt to convey a method to do encrypted search to non-cryptographers. Please excuse the lack of rigour for which I will compensate at the end of the article.

Crytographers do not use diagrams since they have internalized the notation, but I have some illustrations to help the uninitiated.

Assume you have a public key encryption system.

Bob is sending an encrypted message to Alice using Alice's public key

![alice1](/post_images/alice1.jpg)

Alice wants to delegate some checking of messages to Eve.  She wants Eve to check if the encrypted message is her favourite keyword "Nice", but she does not want Eve to know she is looking for "*Nice*".

![alice2](/post_images/alice2.jpg)

How can Eve verify that "*8Ev7*" is actually "*Nice*" in encrypted form ?

What you need here is an auxiliary string called a **trapdoor** which Eve can use to verify the equality.   Encrypting the trapdoor produces the original ciphertext, allowing Eve to verify equality.

The trapdoor can be produced using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map">bilinear map</a> which enables two different ways of producing same encrypted text.

A bilinear map is a function of two variables *f(x, y)* satifying this condition

![eqn1](/post_images/firsteqn.gif)

Let "*x*" be the text to be encrypted.  The encrypted text will be generated by applying f(x, y) where "*y*" is the key combination as shown below.

Next, you have to generate two more items
1. an auxiliary string called the **trapdoor** in the form of original text raised to power of Alpha
2. a mangled public key

as shown in the lower circle

![pic2](/post_images/pic3.jpg)

Now by the property of a bilinear map, the multiplication and division by Alpha cancels as shown below

![pic3](/post_images/pic2.jpg)

This enables two ways of producing the same encrypted text.

A third-party which has the trapdoor "*Vgzv*" along with the mangled public key can test the encrypted text ("*8Ev7*") without decrypting or encryption of the original search string

This is intuitively the first cryptographic construction given by Boneh, et al in Sec 3.1 of their paper[1]

I have played fast and loose here to provide intuition.  Refer to original paper for rigorous explanation.

## How to produce bilinear maps ?  

I am not going into that here. You have to use Weil pairings or Tate pairings over elliptic curves.  

## Diagram of the full construction

There are two more hash functions which come into play in the complete scheme.
