title: Public key encryption with keyword search
---

This is an attempt to convey a method to do encrypted search to non-cryptographers. Please excuse the lack of rigour for which I will compensate at the end of the article.

Crytographers do not use diagrams since they have internalized the notation, but I have some illustrations to help the uninitiated.

Assume you have a public key encryption system.

Let’s say you wanted to allow a third-party to verify whether an encrypted text matches a search string, without 
1. decrypting the encrypted text or 
2. encrypting the search string

Let’s say encryption("*Nice*") produces "*8Ev7*"

How can a third-party verify that "*8Ev7*" is actually "Nice" in encrypted form ?

What you need here is an auxiliary string called a **trapdoor** which the third-party can use to verify the equality.  A trapdoor can be produced using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map">bilinear map</a> which enables two different ways of producing same encrypted text.

A bilinear map is a function of two variables *f(x, y)* satifying this condition

Let "*x*" be the text to be encrypted.  The encrypted text will be generated by applying f(x, y) where "*y*" is the key combination

Next, you have to generate two more items
1. an auxiliary string called the **trapdoor** in the form of original text raised to power of Alpha
2. a mangled public key

as shown below

Now by the property of a bilinear map, the multiplication and division by Alpha cancels as shown below

This enables two ways of producing the same encrypted text !!

A third-party which has the string "*Vgzv*" along with the mangled public key can verify that the plain text is same as encrypted text

This is intuitively the first cryptographic construction given by Boneh, et al in Sec 3.1 of their paper[1]

I have played fast and loose here to provide intuition.  Refer to original paper for rigorous explanation.

## How to produce bilinear maps ?  

I am not going into that here. You have to use Weil pairings or Tate pairings over elliptic curves.  

## Diagram of the full construction

There are two more hash functions which come into play in the complete scheme.
